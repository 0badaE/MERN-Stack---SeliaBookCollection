(App may take a while to load, due to using the free tier 
of my website hoster, do not mistake this as a development issue.) <br/>

<h2>Full-Stack MERN Library </h2>

Main Technologies (not limited to...): 
- Express <br/>
- MongoDB (database) <br/>
- Node.js (CORS, AXIOS, etc..) <br/>
- React <br/>
- React-Router-Dom <br/>
- Tailwind <br/>
- Notistack
- etc.. <br/>


The goal of this project is to showcase my ability to buid
using the MERN stack. In this App, the users can Get, Push, Post and Delete. <br/>

I really focused on making an app with a clean and neatly coded backend
I followed best practices as much as I can, making this code easy to work on,
to collaborate on and come back to in the future. I used MongoDB as the database
and Mongoose as the data manager; I built a scheema using Mongoose. <br/>

As for the front-end; I tried to make a simple minimalistic elegantly designed site, 
I used special tools like snackbar from Notistack to show a beautiful notification once
a app request is made. It shows up green is code 200 is received and red if there's something wrong. 
I used React for the content generating method and Tailwind.css to style the app. Tailwind allows 
me to make it responsive more easily.
